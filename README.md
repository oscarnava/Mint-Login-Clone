# Course: HTML & CSS3
## Second microverse project

This is the first version of the second project for the Microverse training program.
It was developed by Nico and Oscar (the dream team) using basic html tags, form tags,
image map tags and CSS styling.

It's a functional copy of the site [Mint.com](https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html?offering_id=Intuit.ifs.mint&namespace_id=50000026&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmint.intuit.com%2Foverview.event%3Futm_medium%3Ddirect%26cta%3Dhero_sign_up_free_ProspectWeb%26adobe_mc%3DMCMID%253D08497889761544046421391270368961118431%257CMCAID%253D2E930D15050307F2-400011802000029C%257CMCORGID%253D969430F0543F253D0A4C98C6%252540AdobeOrg%257CTS%253D1562794843%26ivid%3D538f0975-5631-4a09-93f2-0c8809828c71). Not every function was
repicated, but we tried to replicate the structure, the look&feel and validation of the
original site.
